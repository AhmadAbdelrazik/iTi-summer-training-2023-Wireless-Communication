.4 Known Limitations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- FSK mode not supported during continuously listening (Class C)
- No official LoRaWAN certification for class C (unicast and multicast messages), V1.0.2
- Following limitations related to the time synchronization:
* GPS epoch time used to synchronize the time on the end-device.
Note that there is a small time different between the GPS epoch and the UTC time. 
Moreover, the configuration of the time zone is not available, so that no correction is performed. 
* The time synchronization is performed if the DeviceTimeAns is received in any unicast class A/C downlink.
This means, that a time synchronization is performed even if the end-device does not send any request.
* Time synchronization not supported by iM881A-M, if DevTimeAns received
